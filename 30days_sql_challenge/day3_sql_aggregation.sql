FROM orders
GROUP BY month
HAVING SUM(total_amount) > 100000;

-- 15. Customers who placed at least 1 order in last 3 months (advanced)
-- This is a conceptual example. Adjust based on your actual data:
SELECT customer_id
FROM orders
WHERE order_date >= DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE) - INTERVAL '3 months'
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date)) = 3;
